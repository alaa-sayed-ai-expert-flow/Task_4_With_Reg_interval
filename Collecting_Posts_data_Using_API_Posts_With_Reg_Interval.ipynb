      "Customers that call into a contact center are often greeted by an automated voice menu (so-called  Interactive Voice Response or IVR) before being transferred to an agent.

      "Customers that call into a contact center are often greeted by an automated voice menu (so-called  Interactive Voice Response or IVR) before being transferred to an agent.

      "Customers that call into a contact center are often greeted by an automated voice menu (so-called  Interactive Voice Response or IVR) before being transferred to an agent. At that moment, using IVR deflection, the caller can be directed to an automated service provided in a chat channel. \n",

      "\n",

      "So the gain from IVR deflection is that you can do easier and more cost effective self service, since you need to hand off to expensive agents only at a later stage. Secondly one agent can handle multiple chat sessions instead of just one voice call. These two factors drive down cost!\n",

      "Customers that call into a contact center are often greeted by an automated voice menu (so-called  Interactive Voice Response or IVR) before being transferred to an agent. At that moment, using IVR deflection, the caller can be directed to an automated service provided in a chat channel. \n",

      "Customers that call into a contact center are often greeted by an automated voice menu (so-called  Interactive Voice Response or IVR) before being transferred to an agent.

      "Customers that call into a contact center are often greeted by an automated voice menu (so-called  Interactive Voice Response or IVR) before being transferred to an agent. At that moment, using IVR deflection, the caller can be directed to an automated service provided in a chat channel. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "So the gain from IVR deflection is that you can do easier and more cost effective self service, since you need to hand off to expensive agents only at a later stage. Secondly one agent can handle multiple chat sessions instead of just one voice call. These two factors drive down cost!\n",

      "Customers that call into a contact center are often greeted by an automated voice menu (so-called  Interactive Voice Response or IVR) before being transferred to an agent. At that moment, using IVR deflection, the caller can be directed to an automated service provided in a chat channel. \n",

      "Customers that call into a contact center are often greeted by an automated voice menu (so-called  Interactive Voice Response or IVR) before being transferred to an agent. At that moment, using IVR deflection, the caller can be directed to an automated service provided in a chat channel. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "So the gain from IVR deflection is that you can do easier and more cost effective self service, since you need to hand off to expensive agents only at a later stage. Secondly one agent can handle multiple chat sessions instead of just one voice call. These two factors drive down cost!\n",

      "Customers that call into a contact center are often greeted by an automated voice menu (so-called  Interactive Voice Response or IVR) before being transferred to an agent. At that moment, using IVR deflection, the caller can be directed to an automated service provided in a chat channel. \n",

      "Customers that call into a contact center are often greeted by an automated voice menu (so-called  Interactive Voice Response or IVR) before being transferred to an agent. At that moment, using IVR deflection, the caller can be directed to an automated service provided in a chat channel. \n",
